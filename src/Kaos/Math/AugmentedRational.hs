Module      : Kaos.Math.AugmentedRational
Description : Exact rational multiples of powers of pi
License     : MIT
Maintainer  : douglas.mcclean@gmail.com
Stability   : experimental

This type is sufficient to exactly express the closure of Q ∪ {π} under multiplication and division.
As a result it is useful for representing conversion factors
between physical units. Approximate values are included both to close the remainder
of the arithmetic operations in the `Num` typeclass and to encode conversion
factors defined experimentally.

data AugmentedRational = Exact Integer Rational -- ^ @'Exact' z q@ = q * pi^z. Note that this means there are many representations of zero.
                       | Approximate (forall a.Floating a => a) -- ^ An approximate value. This representation was chosen because it allows conversion to floating types using their native definition of 'pi'.

-- | Approximates an exact or approximate value, converting it to a `Floating` type.
-- This uses the value of `pi` supplied by the destination type, to provide the appropriate
-- precision.
